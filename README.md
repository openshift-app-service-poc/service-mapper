# Service Mapper

This project will demonstrate how to create provisioned services via service resource maps.

## Description

This project introduces the following CRDs:
* **ServiceResourceMap**: defines the rules needed to generate a ServiceEndpointDefinition for a GroupVersionResource. ServiceResourceMaps are Cluster scoped.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
    kind: ServiceResourceMap
    metadata:
      annotations:
        name: srm-sample-postgresql
    spec:
      service_kind_reference:
        api_group: rds.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1
        kind: dbinstances
      service_map:
        host: path={.status.endpoint.address}
        password: path={.spec.masterUserPassword.name},objectType=Secret,sourceKey=password
        port: path={.status.endpoint.port}
        type: path={.spec.engine}
    ```
* **ServiceProxy**: Namespaced resource that implements the ServiceBinding's specification for Provisioned Service.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
    kind: ServiceProxy
    metadata:
      name: srm-rds-psql-sample
      namespace: srm-rds-sample
    spec:
      service_instance:
        name: srm-rds-psql-sample
        namespace: srm-rds-sample
      service_resource_map: srm-sample-postgresql
    status:
      binding:
        name: srm-rds-psql-sample-sed
   ```

### Users Experience

**Administrator** creates a ServiceResourceMap, the **operator** looks for instances of the services referenced in the ServiceResourceMap and creates a ServiceProxy for each instance.
ServiceProxies are created in the same project/namespace of the service instance.

The **operator** also monitors for events on instances referenced by the published ServiceResourceMap, and creates/updates/deletes related ServiceProxies and ServiceEndpointDefinitions.

When a **Developer** creates an instance of the service in it's project/namespace, the **operator** will then create the ServiceProxy and ServiceEndpointDefinition in the same project/namespace.

The **Developer** can now use the ServiceProxy with the ServiceBindingOperator to bind an application to the service.


## Samples

The following samples are available in the `samples` folder:
- [MongoDB and Minikube](./samples/crd/README.md)
- [Amazon RDS and crc (Openshift 4)](./samples/rds/README.md)


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/service-mapper:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/service-mapper:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
